# Developer Coding Challenge
As the next step in the hiring process, weâ€™d like you to complete a coding challenge.

## The Project

You will be building a basic version of a Ground Resources Management (GRM) Dashboard. There are two JSON files in this repository, *contacts.json* and *alerts.json*. Contacts (satellites) is a list of satellites in orbit and includes pertinent information about each device. Alerts is a list of unrelated status alerts with varying levels of severity. You will need to take this JSON data and persist it in a backend database. You will then develop a backend API, to be called upon by your frontend, which will display the data. This dashboard should allow registration and login of a user, requiring a password, and the user's credentials should also be persisted in your database.

The result should be a dashboard with two pages (the application can be single-page (SPA), or multiple pages):

* A registration/login page
* A main page that displays contact and alert information in a clean, user-friendly format

## Requirements

**Backend**
* The backend of this project can be done in Node, Ruby, or Python. You are permitted to use frameworks/generators such as Express, Ruby on Rails, Flask, etc.
* *contacts.json*, *alerts.json*, and the user data must be persisted in a database. 
  * Each data point should have a corresponding column in the database.
  * You may use any databse tool of your choice, such as PostgresQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.
* API provides frontend with *contacts.json*, *alerts.json*, and verified user credentials.

**Frontend**
* The frontend of this project can be done in React, Vue, or Angular. You are permitted to use any of these frameworks CLI generators to quickly start a project (npx create-react-app, ng new my-app, etc.)
* Login Page Reuirements
  * Authentication is required to access the application
  * User must register for a new account, or login with an existing account, to proceed to the dashboard
* Main Page/Dashboard Requirements
  * The dashboard page cleanly displays the data from *contacts.json*, *alerts.json* in two separate tables
  * The following should be displayed in the Contacts pane:
    * Display the total number of Contacts.
    * Display the total different Contact states (*contactState*).
    * For each Contact, display Name (*contactName*), Status (*contactStatus*), and Begin/End timestamp (*contactBeginTimestamp/contactEndTimestamp*).
    * Allow sorting on the name.
    * Create new contact.
    * Update existing contact.
    * Delete contact.
  * The following should be displayed in the Alerts pane:
    * Display each Alert message (*errorMessage*).
    * Display each Alert category (*errorCategory*).
    * Display each Alert time (*errorTime*).
    * Allow sorting on the category.

## Additional Information
* You are free to use any third-party libraries.
* Have fun and be as creative as you like!
* Please feel free to reach out to ask any questions.
* Use of Docker is a plus!
* Adding unit tests is also a plus!

## How to Submit This Challenge
1. Fork this repository.
2. Work on your solution.
3. **If you are applying for a mid-level or senior-level role:** Deploy the frontend and backend of your application using free services (Netlify, Heroku, etc).
4. Create a pull request with @github/apquinit and @github/edilsalvador as the reviewers. Send us an email at paul.quinit@twala.io and edil.salvador@twala.io when you're ready to have it reviewed and schedule the tech interview.
5. Include in your README documentation the steps on how to setup and run your project on another local machine.

## Timeframe

We would like the take home challenge to be completed within 5 days. If you need more time, please reach out to us. You will not be judged on how quickly you complete the challenge.
